              "'After reaching his hotel in the city, RM revealed that his stay would be for four days and added that he would step out for dinner. As he sat at a roadside open-air restaurant, RM feasted on beer, burgers and fries. He said, \"I\\'m starving right now. I\\'m out to grab some food. It\\'s much quieter than I expected and feels like a rural town. I like the familiar atmosphere.\" RM attended Art Basel and explained on camera the details of the art fair. He also gave a glimpse as he had noodles and beer which was followed by soup noodles and wrap. Showing the pattern of a ping pong table, RM said, \"The table looks like our (BTS) symbol.\" He also spoke about the art pieces as he viewed them. After that, RM took a tram to visit the Foundation Beyeler, a museum. He later took a walk through the city. On his third day, RM visited the Kunstmuseum Basel, the Vitra Design Museum and the gallery. As he walked around, RM showed a chair to his fans and said, \"I have breaking news for you guys. Coldplay\\'s Chris Martin made a chair and it\\'s displayed in the Vitra Design Museum. If you see this Chris, give me a call. You\\'re amazing.\" RM next visited Lucerne and hiked to Mount Rigi. Recalling his previous visit to Lucerne, RM added, \"I remember the day of crossing that bridge and buying souvenirs.\" He was also reminded of Bon Voyage, a reality show featuring BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. Speaking to the camera, RM said, \"I rode the SSB train to Lucerne, rode a boat, rode the mountain train, walked down the track road, rode the cable cars, and now I\\'m on a boat planning to go ride the SSB again.\" RM\\'s travel in Switzerland ended with a visit to the Museum Tinguely. Next, RM flew to Paris to attend the Pinault Collection and to visit Musee d\\'Orsay. He then went to Centre Georges-Pompidou and Orsay Museum. RM\\'s vlog ended with him enjoying a Korean meal and then heading back to Seoul.'"

Jungkookie changed his ID!” Jungkook replied, as translated by Twitter user @sebyul, \"Because it was too long…” When a fan suggested that he go for 'boxing with Taehyungie (V) hyung (brother)', Jungkook said, \"He’s no match for me.” A person also said, “Yoongi-yah (Suga), please marry me” and Jungkook replied, \"Hello, I’m Yoongi?” When asked if he will dye his hair soon, Jungkook said, \"I don’t have any plans [to dye my hair] yet.” When a fan teased the BTS member saying, “Jungkook, do your feet hurt? Because you’re racing through my heart”, he said, \"No wonder… my feet were throbbing.” Another person said, \"Did it not hurt when you fell from the sky??” Jungkook responded, \"It hurt a little, but I’m okay now.” Reacting to his question, a fan asked Jungkook to 'think of ARMY' and he said, \"I do this all the time.” A fan told Jungkook, “Look in the mirror, it’ll be the most fun/interesting thing in the world” and he replied, \"Looking at you is more fun/interesting.” When a fan suggested him to go to a karaoke, he said, \"I wanna go” and when another fan asked about bowling, he said, “Ooh that’s nice?” A fan also asked him to go for a walk but he said he was lazy. A fan asked, \"Did you work out today?” and he said, “Yesterday (Thursday)… so I’m tired right now.” A fan also asked him to choose between banana milk and chicken and Jungkook replied, “Right now, banana.” Jungkook debuted on Instagram, along with other RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, and V, in December last year.

And when it was released, BTS ARMY had turned into Sherlock and had found Taetae aka BTS V in the video. J-Hope's More video featured a glimpse of Kim Taehyung. And now, the new video confirms the theory of ARMYs that V indeed make a cameo in J-Hope's More MV BTS V shocked and surprised J-Hope as he was shooting for his MV, More. He was engrossed in the scene of the shoot and was pleasantly surprised to see Kim Taehyung on the sets. Hobi couldn't stop smiling and was grateful for V to come and cheer on him. J-Hope was seen proudly introducing Kim Taehyung to the cast and crew around on the sets of More. Taetae is one of the biggest cheerleaders of the hyung and the rapline and he has proved it a lot of times already. And seeing him cheer on J-Hope while filming the song More was another proof of his love for his hyungs and their work Taehyung quickly jumped at the opportunity and asked J-Hope if he could be one of the mannequins in his MV. The mannequins were the artists/extras who were extremely still in the video. Kim Taehyung quickly took off his jacket and took place in the rear of the shot. After shooting the scene, Hobi quickly deduces that ARMYs will right away catch his cameo in the MV. And he was right! As soon as the More MV was released, ARMY did indeed catch Kim Taehyung in his tee, jacket and slippers with his toes sticking out. ARMY has a keen eye and a knack for dissecting the MVs and the Bangtan Boys also know how ARMY's mind works. It's rare to see a Boyband and their fandom know each other so well A couple of hours ago, J-Hope shared a new teaser. This time, it's called Hope in the Box. It seems like a new single or a new teaser of his album Jack in the Box. It looks quite sinister and dark. Hobi is experimenting with his music, style and even himself with his new album. Must say, this break to explore themselves as artists is working amazingly well for them       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

He didn't mind doing another take just for the right shot. Jungkook also gave inputs of his own while shooting for the song and was his confident self, as always One thing that can be noticed in Dreamers MV shoot BTS is that Jungkook felt quite hot due to the hot weather in Qatar. He called the residents of Qatar invincible for dealing with all the heat. The assistants were seen holding handheld fans to keep Jungkook cool as well. Despite the heat, Jungkook found Qatar beautiful. He also talked about seeing ARMYs up close and thanked them for cheering on him while he shot for the MV In the video, we can see Jungkook taking off his jacket since it is hot. It has exposed the tattoos on his arm. ARMY is going crazy over his sleeve-length tattoos. Some even cannot get over his adorable interaction with a falcon.

BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook said they were taking a break, The Korea Singers Association president Lee Ja Yeon on Wednesday requested the group to 'reconsider the decision to go on a group hiatus'  In an official statement, Lee Ja Yeon urged the members to rethink the call 'for the future of South Korea's music industry'  In the note, she also said that it's 'difficult to hope for the next BTS to emerge any time soon'  The statement also read that if BTS 'goes away' then the group's fandom ARMY will also follow suit  (Also Read | BTS' RM thinks he 'hit a kind of wall', says he needs to create music 'that’s more timeless')Recently, during BTS' Festa dinner, the group revealed that will take a break  After their announcement, ARMY supported their decision for taking rest  However, HYBE later clarified that BTS is not taking a hiatus  BTS members, RM, V and Jungkook individually also told fans that they will not go on a hiatus nor are they disbanding  They recently announced their anthology album Proof  Lee Ja Yeon's statement, as quoted by Allkpop, read, \"I'm overcome by my fear and concern that the 'BTS Hallyu Wave', a movement possessing the greatest cultural soft power that the world has ever witnessed, will vanish soon  In the years leading up to the birth of this movement, it was believed that finding the 'Next Beatles' would be a very difficult achievement, and now, we have arrived at a point where it is difficult to hope for the 'Next BTS' to emerge any time soon  Thus, there is great concern that the heartbeat of Hallyu will cease  The decision to publish this statement was not an easy one  Please, will you reconsider the decision to go on a group hiatus, for the future of South Korea's music industry?\"She added \"If BTS goes away, the missionaries of Hallyu and Korean culture, ARMYs, also go away  South Korea's tourism industry will suffer, and it will be difficult to hope for a future for South Korea as a hub of culture in Asia  The special laws allotted to the sports and the classical music and arts industries for mandatory military service must be extended to popular culture as well  The need for attention and action regarding this existing issue is pressing  The government and the national assembly of South Korea must pay mind to this matter so that the Hallyu boom can continue to spread, and BTS can continue to promote actively as a group  Please pursue a revision of existing military service laws \"Reacting to the statement, ARMY took to Twitter saying the request was 'wrong' and urged BTS to take rest  A fan tweeted, \"This is so wrong the amount of pressure she's putting on them  They are taking a break and it's a must for their health now  No one has the right to demand  Everyone should understand this  Just give them time to rest  Bts, Army forever \"“You’ve done so much for us already! take as much time as you need and enjoy it, we’ll always be waiting for you #BTSItsOkayToRest,\" said another person  \"Take as much as time you need  Do anything you love  And someday when you decide to come back, you’ll find ARMY waiting here for you  Cause we exist for BTS and BTS only,\" read

name of the band's 2020 album. The fans are convinced that other members of the K-pop group must have also gotten similar tattoos, as they had previously discussed on several occasions. V had spoken about it on Weverse, saying, “We’ve been talking about friendship tattoos forever. We’ll do it someday. Please look forward to it.” RM had also talked about it in a V Live, revealing that they have had discussions about getting a friendship tattoo. He had said, \"Let’s tattoo seven dots or do seven of something. Or just simply tattoo the number seven. But if we’re actually doing it, I want to do it on the ankle. You know, it’s simple.” RM went with his last idea and tattooed the number seven on his ankle. ARMY flooded Twitter with comments about the tattoo. One wrote, \"OMG they got the 7 tattoo,\" while another commented, \"They finally did it.\" A third one wrote, \"OMGGG the friendship tattoo. I am screaming, crying.\" Another said, \"They freaking did it they got the tattooooooo.\" BTS will soon celebrate the ninth anniversary of its debut. They will also perform their album Proof live to mark the occasion on June 13, for which they will be joined by a 'special guest.'       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

seems like the fun isn’t over, as BTS’ V took to the group’s Twitter account to rename it to ‘Golf Genius Kim Taehyung’, and changed the bio to ‘No No Kim Taehyung’  The BTS member didn’t stop there, and even changed the account’s profile photo and header image to his own photos Check out BTS’ latest Twitter layout, courtesy of V, below:V’s Twitter update appears to be a response to fellow BTS member Jimin’s April Fool’s prank yesterday  On April 1, Jimin took to Twitter to hack BTS’ account and renamed it to his own name ‘박지민(jimin park)’, and set the bio to ‘anyway Park Jimin’  He even changed the layout to set his childhood image as the profile photo, and the header image to one of him with blue hair  To make the situation funnier, it seems as though Jimin attempted to reset the account to the way it originally was but failed, seeing as he soon followed these updates with an adorable Tweet saying “Don’t know how to change to the original  Anyway don’t know ” Jimin’s April Fool’s fun didn’t end there, as he then proceeded to update his Instagram account, by changing the profile picture to one of Bang Si Hyuk or Hitman Bang as he is known as and switching his bio to ‘Father of BTS’ BTS’ eldest member Jin, and the group’s leader RM had also joined in on the fun  While Jin changed his Instagram profile photo to one of the characters from the game ‘League of Legends’, Jhin, RM also tried changing his name to ‘MR’, though the process brought a lot of grief to the BTS member, documented on his Instagram stories Join the biggest community of K-Pop fans live

Referring to the concept of the Wooga Squad being a part of the show, Seo-joon asked V, \"How did this happen?\" A laughing Woo-shik said, \"I didn't even shave\" while Seo-joon added, \"This is crazy.\" Peakboy then asked the cameraperson if everything was 'impromptu'. V replied, \"I just thought we could try it.\" As everyone continued laughing, Seo-joon repeated what V told him earlier, \"Let's just do it\" and V said, \"Trust me.\" The next part of the video reveals that V planned a 'four-day friendcation trip' during the winter season this year. Peakboy asked, \"Do we just go and act like we're having fun?\" and Seo-joon replied, \"Not acting, have fun for real.\" The video next showed the friends suggesting activities for their vacation. Peakboy proposed fishing, Woo-shik said campfire and V suggested ice skating. Next, the Wooga Squad went fishing and said, \"It's starting to feel like a real trip.\" Peakboy was left shocked after he managed to catch a few fish. After that, BTS' V and Seo-joon goofed around inside an ice skating rink. They also laughed as they all took a dip inside a hot tub. They also cooked a meal as they sat outdoors and laughed holding sparklers. As they sat around a bonfire, Peakboy talked about a personal incident, \"I've never told anyone this but I've said 'Can you just listen to me just this once?'\" Woo-shik also shared, \"That one time I really was jealous.\" Hyung-sik said, \"I'm not good at expressing.\" V said, \"My walls are down when I'm with you guys.\" Seo-joon added, \"Because we all know each other so well.\" As the video came to an end, the members lay together in a dark room. Someone asked V, \"Taehyung, are you crying?\" Another person lifted the blanket from his face and said, \"He's crying.\" A third person asked, \"What? Why are you crying?

I'm guessing it felt like that even more because it was a year we weren't able to meet you guys that often, isn't it? But still, I think that there were many things that happened this year despite it going by so fast. We laughed cried and were so happy meeting you guys after so long since Covid-19 was over, we released our album and had promotions, we hard a large-scale concert in my hometown Busan, we were able to witness the performances of the albums Hobi hyung and Namjoon hyung worked hard preparing for, and our Seokjin hyung enlisted as well. Hehe.” Jimin shared how he has been busy working on his music and meeting composers. “I just want all of us to go to a place where all of you are there and sing, hear you sing together with us while waving your army bombs, and look at you smile. I keep longing for that always. I think I feel like that cause we weren't able to meet as much as each other wanted to. I somewhat can't put my words together unlike the previous years, I don't know what I'm saying or what I mean. I just hate worrying you, hate making you wait and I feel sorry about it and yet I'm thankful to you and I miss you and I want to do better (for you) and I'm just spending this year that way and sending it off everyone. Wishing you a very Happy New Year !Don't get hurt and don't get hurt and be happy and have a happy new year. I love you and love you again,” he also added. On the other hand, Jungkook who has been away from social media for a while, posted, “Receive a lot of blessings for the New Year (happy new year) ARMY 2023! Every time! Always! I hope you (all) are healthy and happy I hope you guys don't get sick/hurt physically or emotionally.” V aka Kim Taehyung who recently turned a year older, joined the social bandwagon. He added to fans, “Receive a lot of blessings for the New Year (happy new year) I hope everyone is healthy this year and starts (the year) with a happy day.” Responding to everyone’s post, J-Hope sent them love. Meanwhile, fans have taken to Twitter to react to the heartfelt wishes from BTS members. BTS consists of RM, Jin, SUGA, J-hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook. Currently, Jin is serving in South Korean army.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

I was like 'wow, he can sing very beautifully' and when I turned to look, it was Jungkook BTS. At first, I'm not sure so I asked other people, 'Does Jungkook have his lower right lip pierced?' My friend said to look at the tattoos on his hand and it's really him lol.\" Reacting to the post, a fan wrote, \"Thank you for waiting till the end to ask for autograph & let our Kookie enjoy the show. I'm so thankful she respected his privacy! and Jungkook is the sweetest. All of his interactions whenever he meets ARMYs are so sweet & special!!\" Another person said, \"You are a lucky girl. Thanks for respecting his privacy and approaching him at the proper time.\" \"The fact that JK took the time to ask where she's from? Then proceeded to greet her in her language? My heart just melted. Why is he so pure and kind?\" read a tweet. On Saturday, Jungkook headed to Washington, D.C. for BTS' meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House. In videos and pictures shared online by fans, Jungkook sent finger hearts to fans and saluted them. He also bowed to the paparazzi inside the Seoul airport. BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin and V will arrive in the US on Sunday.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

Jeon Jungkook makes fun of whatever you do so but I'd end up laughing every time (Jungkook followed Yoongi's choreo). The members monitored the music video a lot for me. I was in the middle of filming when it came out so they told me then I couldn't watch (the MV). It was the same around Daechwita, I can't really watch the MV I'm on as much,\" Twitter user @BTStranslation_ quoted Suga. Suga also said, as translated by @rmkkyu, \"Originally, I was only going to feature, only feature in the music video. I was only going to feature and then leave but… one thing led to another, I danced.\" Suga also said, as per @rmkkyu, the filming location for That That and Permission To Dance was the same, and the car model for That That and Daechwita was also the same. As translated by @BTStranslation_ , Suga had sent another song to PSY which he said no to at first. The song was detailed but PSY wanted to do a different style, so they ended up doing That That. Suga wrote the hook/chorus That That I Like That and PSY wrote the other parts. That That, part of PSY's latest album PSY 9th, released on April 29 and has been produced by Suga. Talking about the collaboration with PSY, Suga had said as quoted by news agency ANI, \"At first, because he's many years my senior and someone who's well-respected in the business I was quite nervous. It felt like working with a childhood friend so it made the songwriting process that much more fun. We became besties in a way.\" The album has 12 songs, including one featuring Korean-Canadian rapper Tablo. Meanwhile, BTS' logo trailer for their new album, titled Proof, was released recently. The new album will have a mix of new and old songs and will be an anthology album. In a statement, BigHit Music had said, “After ceaselessly sprinting forward since 2013, BTS is celebrating their 9th anniversary this coming June. It is all thanks to ARMY who have sent us your unwavering love and support.

He said, \"Just an important business. We know each other well right. I didn’t even use English.\" Another fan said, \"So Olivia listened to Korean and acted she was so surprised. You are really a pro.\" V replied, \"I didn’t say Korean (to her too).\" When a fan said, \"It is so funny that you didn’t use English. Olivia is very good at acting\", V replied, \"She is a hero Olivia.\" A fan asked V if he felt sad for not winning the Grammys. He replied, as translated by Twitter user, @BTStranslation_, \"Since Doja's song is really good so it's right, haha it was clean. But I cried.\" A fan said, \"Grammy was not a big deal.\" V replied, \"I’m so sorry but I heard these words for about 20,000 times. Seems like you need to find another word.\" When a fan asked how he felt after he met Lady Gaga, V said, \"I’m so sorry..(purple heart emoji). It feels so great.\" V also responded to a fan asking him on giving Suga money at the Seoul airport ahead of their recent US travel. The fan asked, \"Please explain the airport 10000 Korean won ( ₹623 approx) rumour.\" The singer said, \"There was 10000 won inside my pocket and I know I will lose it someday so I just gave someone who in front of me.\" When a fan said that Las Vegas is difficult to pronounce and added that they will stay awake till 2 am like V, he laughed and said, \"I also haven’t been to Las Vegas that much so I don’t really know.\" When a fan asked if they leave BTS fandom and start liking another male idol, what would he do, V replied, \"Should you must leave? Hahahahahaha. No, but you can like both of them right.\" Another ARMY said that they won't leave BTS ever. V responded, \"Right, we're gganbu (best buddies) right. My sleep suddenly went away.\" A fan shared the news that they became prefect and V said, \"Oh!! As expected Weverse got some interesting questions like this. What do you want to do after you became a prefect? Shaving those kids’ hair and send them back home again before they dress their uniform neatly.\" When a fan asked if he watched the K-drama Business Proposal, V said, \"So there was someone proposed in our company? Is it a funny situation?\" BTS members are all set for their four in-person concerts--Permission To Dance On Stage in Las Vegas. They will perform at the Allegiant Stadium on April 8, April 9, April 15, and April 16.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

She participated in dance competitions and took lessons in Hindustani classical music to hone her skills. Lenka got a big break when she was selected for six-month training in Seoul to become a member of the Korean pop (K-Pop) band Blackswan. She has been in Seoul since December undergoing singing and dancing practice for hours under the trainers of music company DR Music Entertainment. Blackswan was started by the company as Rania in 2011. It later became BP Rania before getting its current name in October 2020. After its oldest member Hyeme left the group in November 2020, DR Music in May last year announced global auditions to replace her. Lenka, a Korean pop fan, applied for the online audition and was among the 23 shortlisted out of 4,000 applicants from across the world in July. The selections were made after their recorded videos were assessed by the DR Music. Four including Lenka were chosen for the final round for which they had to travel to Seoul for training for one of them would be chosen to replace Hyeme. Two of the four opted out leaving Lenka and Brazil’s Gabriela Dalcin as the final contestants. Lenka’s cousin, Sonali, said in the second round, she had to either dance or do a rap of the song Tonight from the Goodbye Rania album of the group in front of the camera. “She had to dance without any background music and do a rap on the song. A couple of weeks after we uploaded the unedited video of her performance on Google Drive, the company made an announcement on its YouTube channel about her selection,” said Sonali. She added Lenka had already given audition in several other Korean companies and they hoped she will make it. K-pop or Korean pop started out in South Korea in 1990s that included different musical genres such as rock, hip hop and electronic music. As the East Asian country experienced an economic boom in 90s bringing bigger purchasing power among the country’s youth, they gained easier access to American popular culture and artists. As per moonROK, a K-pop news portal, the foundation of K-pop was laid in 1992 with an electric hip-hop TV performance by Seo Taiji and Boys. Soon K-pop began spreading in non Asian countries like USA and some European countries. As per Koreaboo.com, the daily schedule of a K-pop trainee like Shreya is packed with classes that range from the standard vocal, rap, dance lessons to personal training, language, and musical instruments. Former K-pop idol Minu from the band Boyfriend in her Instagram post revealed that trainees go to the music company as early as 10 am and stay as late as midnight. Lenka’s father Avinash Lenka, who works in a private company in Jharsuguda, encouraged her to follow her passion for dancing. “From her childhood, she always wanted to be a dancer and participated in several dance competitions,” said her mother Priyatama. She added whether her daughter is finally chosen as the fifth member of Blackswan or not is another matter. “But she is focussed on learning Korean language and K-pop music.” Priyatama said her daughter was always focussed. “During school days, she used to head for dance training after reaching home at 2.30 pm and would not come back before 9 pm. I too wanted to pursue dancing but could not fulfil the dream as my father did not approve of it. I do not know if my daughter would become the first K-pop idol from India, but I am happy that she is living her dream.” In a statement, DR Music said Lenka and Dalcin were undergoing basic practice and Korean language education. “They will go through...six months of training. It is the final audition. We have prepared to prove through the training process that they themselves are eligible to debut as K-pop artists. Therefore, we will evaluate whether they have the basic skills to perform as a K-pop artist, such as their personality and qualities...” Sonali said her cousin’s schedule is hectic.

their album Pink Venom. They are in the US. The girls went on the Jimmy Kimmel show where they did a live performance of the song. It seems Rose outdid herself with her moves and amazing vocals. Now, the host said that 'kids' were super excited to see BLACKPINK on the Kimmel stage. This has not gone down well with K-Pop fans. It is a known fact that the popular groups have fans across age groups and ethnicities. Some time back, James Corden referred to BTS fans as 15-year-old fangirls and ARMY did not take it lightly at all. In fact, the host apologized to RM aka Kim Namjoon when they came on the show during the LA Concert promotions Now, Kim Jisoo had to miss the 2022 Seoul Drama Awards to be present for the promotions of Pink Venom. She was awarded the Best Actress for Snowdrop. Blinks and solo fans of Jisoo are upset that she had to miss out because of Jimmy Kimmel. Some have even termed the performance as boring. They feel YG Entertainment should have done better with the promotions of Pink Venom. Snowdrop saw a heartfelt performance from Kim Jisoo. This was her acting debut Jisoo's vocals have also got praise in the Blackpink comeback. The singer is seen as the eldest sister of the group, and has been their emotional anchor. Kim Jisoo won at the fan voted event. Even Kim Seon-Ho who is world famous for his poignant acting in Hometown Cha Cha won an award       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

Gone are the days when we would get updates only from Weverse or Twitter. The latter seems dormant to another level. But there's no dearth of BTS content. In fact if anything, the BTS members – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook – have all been showcasing their never-before-seen sides with shirtless pics, bare-face selfies and whatnot. It won't be wrong to say that they have been setting thirst traps for ARMYs. And today, we will have a look at some of the thirst traps that the Bangtan Boys have set First up, we have BTS leader Kim Namjoon aka RM. From pictures from the bath tub to a selfie after workout or from the gym flaunting his biceps and handsome built, ARMY cannot get enough of the BTS leader Mr Worldwide Handsome has been making ARMYs cry these days. Kim Seokjin is soon going to enlist in the military. While the ARMYs are proud, they are going to miss WWH Jin. Who will ever forget the time when Jin shocked ARMYs by dropping a shirtless picture to flaunt his tattoo? Also, Jin working out in the jin created a huge stir. The exposed forehead to his photoshoot in a vest, Jin often makes ARMY go gaga Nobody can do it like Yoongi. He just sets a thirst trap with selfies and close-up shots. Of course, on stage Suga is quite HOT. Here are some of the close-up shots of Yoongi that left ARMYs gasping for breath. His crooked smirk is also quite famous Earlier, there was a time when just a forehead being exposed was considered a huge thing in the kpop world. And these days, especially after BTS made their debut on Instagram, they have been sharing posts unfiltered. Hobi has been dropping a lot of bare body selfies leaving ARMYs in a tizzy. Also, on stage personality of J-Hope is super hot! Jimin's visuals are very different from his personality when with the group. He is often teased about his height and comes across as a shy and kind-hearted one. However, Jimin can flirt with ARMYs just with his gestures and expressions. He is a fantastic dancer and it's impossible to take one's eyes off him when he is on stage. Jimin also loves to flaunt his abs and tattoos Where do we even begin with BTS V aka Kim Taehyung? He is considered the king of visuals. And honestly, he often seems unreal. Be it his bare body selfies/videos or his photoshoots, Taehyung has often left ARMY gasping for breath. Sometimes, Taehyung steals everything just with his expressions. ARMYs go gaga all the time Last but not least, we have the Golden Maknae Jungkook on the list. Jungkook is usually considered a baby. But everyone knows he's not a baby. Jungkook loves working out and ARMY loves his boxing videos a lot. Sadly, he deleted them all.

It’s time to run. Our favourite variety show starring the hilarious members- RM, Jin, SUGA, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook of BTS, ‘Run BTS’ is back next week. After a break of 10 months, the squad returns with their chaos on August 16.In a new clip shared ahead of the premiere, the teaser of the special episode has been revealed. Titled ‘Run BTS! 2022 Special Episode - Telepathy Part 0’, the seven boys of the group make their grand return. At the start of the teaser, we can see the septet marking the historic day by cheering with a glass of what appears to be champagne and shouting out their iconic ‘Run BTS’ in style.The group then engages in a fun game of telepathy where they are tested on their knowledge of each other. Initially calling themselves ‘one body and soul’, they soon turn confused with all the information coming their way. Questioning their memories and sifting through more than a decade of content, they eventually- albeit reluctantly- admit to not being good at the game. Soon, they are dragged to a new location with blindfolds on their eyes and only each other to guide them on the path.Check out the teaser below.https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpKFqkDz4ccInterestingly, a new theme song greets the viewers and like we are sure most of them must have already guessed it, BTS’ song ‘Run BTS’, off of their latest album ‘Proof’ plays in the background.

Hobi recently shared a couple of pictures from his Hope Film on his social media handle. they are pictures of the BTS members. The pictures seem from BTS' SoFi stadium concert. The pictures include everyone - RM, Jin, Jimin, Hobi and Jungkook, but for Taehyung and Suga J-Hope shared the pictures and captioned it saying Film 2. He posted an apology to BTS V aka Kim Taehyung and Suga aka Min Yoongi for not having their pictures in his film. \"Sorry for @thv n @agustd,\" The Mama and Chicken Noodle Soup hitmaker wrote in the comments Now, ARMY has come out in support of TaeGi aka Taehyung and Yoongi and have been sharing their pictures together, to make up for it. Also, they are hoping for a TaeGi selca as well A couple of days ago, Suga had shared a post on his Instagram handle and Hobi had dropped a comment soon after.

ARMYs have been sharing clips of the same online and have been going gaga over how close the BTS members really are. The Bangtan Boys' goofiest and adorable sides along with the hottest personalities are seen in Memories of 2021. Talking about the goofiness of the Bangtan Boys, we came across a clip from Memories of 2021 which features RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook shooting together. The Tannies reject one of Jungkook's ideas during a photoshoot. And it's relatable and hilarious at the same time It so happened that the BTS members were shooting the concept photos for Festa 2021. And for the same, the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and JK – were seen in colourful outfits that made them look like cotton candies of different colours. They were all copying poses suggested by each of the BTS members. RM suggested a Michael Jackson posture, Hobi suggested a crab posture, and Suga had a cute posture, too. BTS V aka Kim Taehyung had the easiest one out of all. He suggested striking his signature V pose for the pictures Out of them all Jimin, Jungkook and Jin had difficult postures. Jimin's posture was that of sitting on a chair in the air. Jin's was a hard side-way lean which almost tripped Taehyung. But the most difficult of it all was Jungkook's posture. It was a Yoga posture wherein one balances his/her body on his hand. And right away, the idea was rejected by the members. It's funny and relatable at the same time. Jungkook is fond of exercising and working out. So are others but sometimes, the things that Jungkook does easily are difficult for the rest of the Bangtan Boys Meanwhile, during Festa Dinner this year, the BTS members announced that they will be taking a break from the hectic work schedule as the boyband. They are now 'focussing' on their individual artistry. And it just means more content of BTS members for the ARMY       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

Given the intense feelings of fans, BTS tends to be a bit wary about responding to romantic lines written by them. But that does not mean that they are not romantic. Some days back, the Dalmajung Merch collection was released by BTS. The items are very pretty. But even more are the love letters written by BTS for ARMYs. Yes, Dalmajung means in Korean to meet the moon. Like Bollywood films, in Korean the moon is symbolic of love, longing and lovers. The boys have written thoughts for ARMYs and we cannot help but swoon It can be said comfortably that the hyung line of BTS is much more romantic than we assume them to be. The English translation of the letters will make you think so. From yearning about lovers to sending love-soaked lines about fleeting moments of togetherness, the boys have shown that they can bring it on when it comes to romance ARMY has gone crazy after reading this. Like no one would expect Bangtan Boys to write love letters for fans. Check out some of the crazy reactions here BTS aka Bangtan Boys is loved all over the globe for their artistry, humility, charm and good looks. But desi fans must have noticed how these love letters are so similar to Bollywood's references of the moon, love and longing       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

On the occasion of Valentine’s Day, ARMYs go into the imagination mood. Well, many of them are in that frame of mind 365 days a year but V-Day further amplifies the feelings. BTS members RM, SUGA, Jimin, Jin, Jungkook, J-Hope or V rarely discuss their private lives or what they feel about love or romance. However, BTS ARMY can imagine what kind of boyfriends they did be or perhaps what would turn them in partners. In fact, some members like SUGA, Jin and Jungkook have said some truly romantic things in front of BTS ARMY that made hearts mushy. BTS leader RM can tease fans, that too in the most sophisticated of manner. And what would we say about Jimin and V. Many fans feel that Kim Taehyung is the God Of Romance and Seduction in BTS while Jimin is the lover who has a heart full of warmth. Just ahead of Valentine’s Day 2022, let us see the romantic quotient of the Bangtan Boys… BTS maknae Jeon Jungkook is quite a romantic. He once said he did do anything for the girl he loves. Jungkook also made fans feel mushy when he said he did like to recreate the epic kissing scene from the movie Love 911. This proves that he is quite a romantic at heart BTS member J-Hope has a passion for dance and keeping others happy. Jung Hoseok or Hobi is perceptive, hard-working and caring. ARMYs felt very sad when he revealed that he was dumped by his girlfriend in school. J-Hope loves romantic shows as they inspire his lyric-writing. He said he dreams of finding true love like the one seen on Crash Landing On You. Isn’t that too romantic? ARMYs can dream of that one epic love story knowing this fact about Hobi In an old video, BTS Jin has spoken about how he dreams of cooking food with his partner when he has one. In fact, he said that his food got burnt at times as he was too deep in the thought. If food is your language of love, then Kim Seokjin is your perfect Valentine’s Day date. He can make you a great meal, tell you dad jokes and go the extra mile to have you roll on the floor with laughter. BTS Jin is quite traditional in his ideals of love BTS rapper, music producer and songwriter SUGA is on a high. Old BTS ARMYs know that Min Yoongi has a way with words. He told fans to keep their fourth finger empty (for the marriage ring), and coolly asked for the documents when someone proposed to him. SUGA is always flooded with marriage proposals and why not. Min Yoongi can sing, play instruments, write you a song, prepare a nice meal and even take you for a long drive (he has a grade one driving license). SUGA has written some of the most romantic notes for fans some of which are part of old BTS archives. The letter written for his former girlfriend is a reflection of how he feels about relationships and love BTS front-man RM is admired by millions. A skilled rapper, composer, music producer and songwriter RM is the complete package. He can also be a tease if he wants to. Remember what he said to husbands of ARMYs on the Zoom pyjama party. Fans dream that a date with RM would mean a walk through a museum enjoying art or soaking in the sights of nature. He is a man who loves all the finer things of life. Though he has not spoken about his romantic side, ARMYs only imagine how life would be with a man as hot and intelligent as Kim Namjoon. He is the perfect Valentine’s Day date for all sapiosexuals BTS member V is known for his good looks, charisma and deep baritone. Whether it is Sweet Night from Itaewon Class or Christmas Tree from Our Beloved Summer, he is someone who has given some truly romantic OSTs. In fact, his video from Hawaii where he was singing Travel With Me while driving a Mustang conjured up images in the minds of ARMY on how romantic Kim Taehyung could be as a partner. From sharing pics of starlit skies to setting up thirst traps at 3 am posing shirtless, BTS V is known as the God of Seduction BTS Jimin is full of love, warmth and compassion. Jimin once said he wanted to meet the parents of ARMYs for giving birth to such loving fans. He is also someone to reach out with empathy and kindness. His recent note for a fan is proof. If you love kindness is a man, he is your perfect guy       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

Now, one incident has been reported where a former sasaeng fan of the septet from Japan revealed how her obsession affected her life. It seems she was recruited by a Korean sasaeng who had told her to follow the band, and find out if Jungkook was dating someone or not. Koreaboo has revealed an incident which has been narrated on a YouTube channel Kisses Dahlia. A Japanese fan has said that she became a K-Pop fan in 2017, and BTS was her fave It seems she became famous because of the high quality pics that she took when she went to their concerts. This led to her being approached by a Korean sasaeng. She was given a 'job' to spy on the boys and take their pics. It seems she took up the offer because she needed the money. However, the sasaeng culture is very exhausting and found it worrying when she started enjoying the act of spying on the boys. The fan has said that her sister found out that she is a sasaeng and sent her for therapy. The girl has said that she is regretful of her actions and understands how sasaeng culture is harmful Even today Jimin said that some fans were calling him when he was doing his VLive with J-Hope after the Lollapalooza Festival. Fans wondered if they were sasaengs who were troubling the boys. We also remember how Jungkook kept getting calls in the middle of the night as he did a VLive chat during the Las Vegas tour. Sasaengs have been known to book tickets in same flights as the boys due to which they stopped taking commercial flights. Once, a sasaeng tried to kiss SUGA but was held by the bodyguard       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

But Jungkook left a day or two before the rest of the boys. The label Big Hit Music said that Jeon Jungkook left early to oversee some arrangements. But they did not elaborate much. It is possible that BTS is planning an earth-shattering performance at the Grammys or maybe at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. But sharp ARMYs have noticed a development that has got people curious. They are speculating that we might see a collaboration between Ariana Grande and Jungkook soon. She is one of his favourite singers. Moreover, BTS and Ariana Grande are managed by the same label now as HYBE has taken over Ithaca Holdings Jungkook's latest song Stay Alive produced by SUGA of BTS has crossed 70 million streams on Spotify. Jungkook is also the only BTS member who has escaped COVID-19. J-Hope is supposed to join the rest of the band mates in the coming week. The Las Vegas concerts are going to be huge affairs It seems the whole city will be turned into purple. There are BTS themed hotels too for fans       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

                                             BTS leader RM aka Kim Namjoon has given fans many inspiring messages. This year, Big Hit Music had to twice release statements denying news of his rumored wedding with the daughter of a rich Korean businessman. Now, the leader of BTS has expressed his views on marriage, and it is profound. As we know, he is one of the anchors on the show The Dictionary Of Useless Knowledge. A clip is going viral from the show where BTS RM aka Kim Namjoon says he grew up believing that marriage was a normal part of growing up, and something everyone had to do. But as he grew up, he realised the enormity of the whole decision and how it is scary. And he said that self realization came that what is the standard norm might not be the best choice for him The words have found resonance with many ARMYs. As we know, BTS never discusses their personal life. They avoid talking about dating and stuff too. This is one of the rare occasions when someone has said something. Like Namjoon, the thought is very relatable yet profound. Take a look at how ARMY and fans reacted on the same BTS member and leader Kim Namjoon has wowed the music critics and everyone with his first solo album, Indigo. It has got over 80 million streams on Spotify in the first week. It is the highest for a Korean soloist. He is followed by J-Hope's Jack In The Box album       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

spoke about his discussion with fellow BTS members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook during Festa dinner on Tuesday  The members had spoken about the group's future activities and got teary-eyed after speaking about their hiatus  (Also Read | BTS in tears as they announce hiatus at Festa dinner to work on solo projects: 'Not like we’re disbanding')As translated by Twitter user @eternalhyyh, RM said, “After the show was aired, this is the most number of calls I've received since we debuted  When I took a look at the screenshots and article titles (people sent to me), there were quite a lot of provocative and partially interpreted keywords in them such as disband, hiatus, big announcement, etc  It's not like we didn't know this will take place nor that we didn't prepare for this but indeed it feels bitter ”\"It's not that I was expecting you to watch the entire video where we cry and express everything Be it a type of irregular content such as Bangtan 'Company Dinner', or the symbolism of June 13th, the date it was aired itself  That video was completely dedicated to all the armys who have been together with us through the past 9 years,\" he also wrote RM also added, \"Of course, there will be reactions from outsiders saying that we're making a fuss, we're talking highly and mighty, etc  But to just say that 'wouldn't any other artist or fandom say the same thing', there's definitely something special that exists only between BTS and ARMY as much as the contents we've released through the time of almost 10 years that we've been running without a stop  This feeling is a question that we've received countless times through the interviews so far, but for some reason, it is quite difficult to describe in a few words and I find it hard too \"RM continued, “Anyways, that was a confession (of love) and confession (of sin) that we had to make to all our fans who have been communicating with us so far without putting a value on that speciality  Though those who watched the video will understand, that just as the song title Yet To Come suggests, it's true that what we genuinely wanted to say is that now is not the end  And since only the screenshot of the part where I sobbed was taken and keeps spreading everywhere (with no context), I also wonder if I got carried away under the influence of alcohol ”He added, \"Indeed, it looks like the courage to be honest always ends up in unnecessary misunderstandings and creates disaster  What I wanted to say is that we're two (individual + group)  We spoke as one, and we only shared all those sentiments that poured out in the process of that through courage and tears  I believe that if you are ARMYs who know us, you will be generous enough to understand that and not once I will doubt that  What we said in the video is everything \"“Though Jungkook or Taehyung already explained it well through Vlive, we've always been open about the long-term future of BTS  Though there weren't times we didn't quarrel and be sulky, I believe that it's the trial and error to mature into an adult starting from the social life of our early days  Though I'm afraid that this post will be yet another mess  or be an act that will fuel the fire of all the existing noises, as the concerned person who spoke the most, I (came to) briefly talk about the main points,\" he further wrote “Thank you to everyone who watched the video, and sent us good support, love and energy be it from far away or close by  I will continue to work hard to show you better sides as a team and as an individual as well  Thank You,\" concluded his post       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

And some are pretty obsessive ones. The three young members are also the faves of shippers. While celebrating the friendship between members is fine, it is problematic when people assume they are couple. Of late, a smear campaign on Kim Taehyung by JiKook shippers from Japan was exposed. The campaign planned to bring disrepute to the name of BTS V aka Kim Taehyung as the fans believed that Jungkook and Jimin were the real thing. The campaign was exposed by a Japanese fan who said that genuine ARMYs from the country were reporting such malicious mischief-makers However, now Weverse has been flooded with hate comments about Kim Taehyung. ARMYs are downright disgusted with the whole development. Of late, there has been too much drama around BTS V aka Kim Taehyung. The whole dating rumor with Blackpink rapper Jennie Kim kept him in the news and how. This is how ARMY has reacted to the recent spate of hate comments on Weverse. Take a look We  can see that BTS fans are super upset with what has happened. The Winter Bear singer Kim Taehyung is rumoured to be on a variety show that will be filmed in Mexico. Jungkook is going to perform solo at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

The vocalist flaunted his friendship tattoo by posing shirtless. BTS ARMY went into a frenzy as Kim Seokjin is known to be a shy person. Jin stans could not control themselves on social media, and there was utter chaos after that thirst trap. After flaunting his hot avatar, Kim Seokjin aka Jin has gone back to being adorable. From pics at the pic to posing against the gorgeous beaches of Jeju Island, he is winning us over. It is a known fact that Jin aka Kim Seokjin loves to eat His recent pic was of his eating what looked like a long roll. Fans were confused with what was the dish. Korean ARMY informed others that it was a Galchi which in English is a hairtail fish. It is one of the longest fishes found in Asia and is loved by Koreans. In India, it is called Karli Fish. Some desi BTS fans confused it with dosa. Just check out some of the funny tweets here In the pic, we can see him with a cute smile on his face. He is wearing a white and looks like he had booked the whole place for himself.

are dating if a certain section on Twitter is to be believed. The latest is a series of alleged dating pics from a restaurant in Gyeonggi. It is a town on the outskirts of Seoul. As per the handle, Gurumiharibo, the alleged couple had gone for a lunch date. He had posted some pics where we can see lots of food and half pics of a man and woman claimed to be the superstar idols. Jennie Kim and Kim Taehyung apparently went there. Given the pics are supposed to be fresh leaks, fans are wondering why Blackpink rapper Jennie Kim is not taking any action to stop these pictures Now, in the mean time, a screenshot is claiming that Blackpink singer Kim Jisoo knows the real truth. Some fans are asking her to give a hint to confirm or deny the matter. This is going really out of hand now. It is said that Kim Jisoo is close to the rumoured couple. Take a look at these tweets on social media BTS member Kim Taehyung came on a radio show with his good friend, singer Park Hyosin. Both of them discussed music at length. It seems both are huge fans of Matt Maltese and Troye Sivan. The two had a long chat. Kim Taehyung also waved out at fans who had come outside the radio station       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

The whole thing got rather disgusting with a spate of leaked pics that were allegedly hacked from the phone of the Blackpink star. There was no confirmation on the dating rumors from Big Hit Music or YG Entertainment. The latter however hinted at a breach of privacy. The rumours also sparked off toxic fights between BTS fans and Blackpink stans on social media. Jennie Kim's dating history was dissected, and even GD Dragon, Jimin and Bang PD names were dragged into the whole mess The whole thing does not look like it will end soon. Of late, there are many tweets from rival fans blatantly body-shaming the two idols. As we know, Kim Taehyung aka BTS V is hailed as one of the world's Most Handsome Men while Jennie Kim of Blackpink is termed as desirable by many magazine and polls. Both are music superstars and global icons in their own right. It looks like the whole thing started after Jennie Kim's latest advertisement pics that got millions of likes. She was seen posing in Calvin Klein underwear. Take a look at the tweets Well, some ARMYs are clearly not impressed. As we know, body-shaming can be very damaging. The K-Pop scene is under a lot of scrutiny for how skinny most of the idols are. Genuine music fans told people to focus on the songs instead of going there We can see that the comments are quite disparaging. Blackpink and Jennie Kim are now in the US while Kim Taehyung of BTS is planning on his debut album. He might also travel to Mexico for a variety show as per rumours       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

A fan inspired by V wrote, \"It’s always been my dream to go to a jazz club, but I’ve always felt embarrassed to go since I’m so young and it’s always filled with older people. This video of Tae gives me some confidence, that maybe I should go and not care about what others will think of me.\" Another person tweeted, \"He looks so handsome!!\" \"His outfit really suits to the jazz vibe! I mean Taehyung is the man who gonna dance with/without partner cuz he wants to enjoy and fulfill his every moment beautifully smoothly. His smile and love for every rare collection is something we really love to admire or rare to find,\" said a fan. \"Helppp why does this seem like a scene out of a movie,\" asked a fan. Another person wrote, \"It’s giving main romantic interest vibes, you’re just chilling at a snazzy bar and suddenly you’re distracted by the handsome young man grooving by himself. I live for this.\" \"Kim Taehyung vibing to Fly Me to the Moon dressed like this??? Oh I'm going feral,\" said a person. \"Y’all know that classic vintage edit of Taehyung being an old love that you’ll tell to your kids? this new video of him dancing to jazz smiling so softly has the same energy,\" wrote a fan.

The clip, which was released on Tuesday on Bangtan TV's YouTube channel, showed them recall how they interacted with fans on camera after they debuted with RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope and Jungkook in 2013. The video started with BTS' Jimin and V warming up using a chair before shooting for their track Butter last year. As Jimin lifted the chair over his head, V told him, \"You've to straighten your arms.\" He replied, \"I can't go any higher because of the jacket. Here's the limit (as he showed how far he can lift the chair above him).\" As their staff worked around them, they continued their exercise smiling. Next, Jimin came to the camera as he covered nearly the entire lens. He said, \"Now we only have one last shooting left.\" V peered over his shoulder and asked what he was doing and if he was having fun. Jimin responded by laughing, \"It's what we used to do when we debuted. We used to do this a lot when we debuted. We'd get greedy and want to show more for our fans.\" Jimin then added, \"We are talking now.\" Pointing at V, he said, \"He used to do this a lot.\" V added, \"It's true that I used to say things like that.\" The video ended with Jimin and V talking in 'sim' language, as the caption read, all the while laughing and pulling each other's legs. All the BTS members, who are on an 'extended period of rest', are gearing up for their upcoming concerts in Seoul next month. This will be BTS' first show for th live audience in Seoul since the coronavirus pandemic began. The concerts, Permission to Dance on Stage-Seoul, will take place at Seoul's Olympic Stadium on March 10, 12 and 13, and will also be live-streamed, the group's agency Bit Hit Music had said. Their last concert for South Korean fans was in October 2019, a couple of months before the coronavirus began. As the pandemic spread in 2020, the band postponed and then called off their international tour involving nearly 40 concerts. They held some online shows instead. BTS debuted in 2013 and have produced many songs over the years. In November last year, they created history by becoming the first Asian artists to win the top prize at the American Music Awards. They played their first in-person concerts since the onset of the pandemic in November, in Los Angles. The pandemic also affected a few members--RM, Jin, Suga, Jimin and V, as they contracted the coronavirus. However, all of them have fully recovered.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

The former is in Qatar where he will be performing at the Al Bayt Stadium for the opening of the FIFA World Cup 2022. His presence is creating some controversy as Dua Lipa has opted out saying that she does not support the restrictions on the LGBT community. ICYMI, homosexuality is considered to be criminal offence in Qatar. The officials have said that while the LGBTQ community is welcome, they cannot campaign like holding pride flags and so on. There are rumors that even Shakira might skip the opening ceremony of the World Cup 2022 due to some personal issues. This means that BTS Jungkook will be one of the biggest acts for the day. He has already gone there for rehearsals and recording his parts for the tournament As we know, the Run BTS choreography is going viral everywhere. Jungkook has done a cute version of it and shared on his Insta stories. He is seen in black baggy pants and a white shirt.

Taking to their Twitter account @BTS_twt, the group posted photos as they posed with the eldest member. In the picture, Jin wore a grey T-shirt, matching pants, and a long black jacket. He also wore a cap and white sneakers. All the members stood with him as they posed for the pictures. In the second photo, the members placed their hands on Jin's head, which he recently clean shaved for joining the military. Sharing the pictures, the members wrote, \"My brother!! Come back safely!! Love you.\" They also added purple heart emojis. Earlier, the members also shared posts on their respective Instagram accounts as they bid Jin goodbye. J-Hope shared a string of pictures featuring himself and Jin as they had a meal. The duo also posed for pictures. The photos also gave a close look at the dishes, which J-Hope said that Jin prepared. He captioned the post, \"Let's be healthy and happy bro!!! I love you!!! #Prepared by Seokjin hyung #happy dinner.\" Taking to his Instagram Stories, V dropped a clip from one of their concerts. The video featured him and Jin on the stage. He wrote, \"123 let's not get hurt.\" V also added Jin's recent release, Astronaut, as the background music. Jin's brother Kim Seok-joong took to Instagram and shared a picture of a purple banner hung on the roadside. The message, in Korean, was for Jin. He wrote, \"Good bye.\" Seok-joong geo-tagged the location as Yeoncheon. The area is where frontline troops are deployed on guard against North Korea, as per news agency Reuters. After five weeks' training at the camp, Jin will be deployed to a unit that has not yet been specified. BTS' management, BigHit Music, had said there would be no official event and asked fans to avoid travelling to the boot camp, citing safety concerns.

In an interview, the group members spoke about an ability they would want to acquire this year, a question that provokes them, an alternate profession, among other questions. In a video shared by Vogue Korea on YouTube, Jimin was asked about the words that impressed him the most in 2021. Replying to this, he said, “I remember the words, 'It's how it is'. Since the pandemic continues, lots of people are suffering and each person has different hardships and situations. I also went through some difficult times. I wanted to perform and met our fans too. So there was a time when I felt isolated. As time passed, I began to empathize with and felt the pain of the words, 'It's how it is'.” In the special edition interview, Jungkook was asked about the words that he wants to hear the most in 2022. He responded, \"Since there's no one who doesn't like compliments. I guess 'cool' would be the best. 'Cool' could be interpreted in various ways. It could mean the personality's cool or the performance on the stage is cool or the voice is cool. It can explain a lot of things, so I like the words, 'So cool'. So in 2022, I hope to hear such a word.\" BTS' V was asked if he could obtain a new ability this year, what would he choose. He replied, “Besides music and dance, I want to get the ability to play the instruments well. When it comes to instruments, one has to invest lots of time into the songs they want to play and in the end, they can feel a huge sense of accomplishment. But, I don't know how to play instruments. I used to play the saxophone often back then, but I found out that it was too hard to play all the songs I love with just saxophone. So, whether it's trumpet, clarinet or violin, I'd like to play all the songs I like, so I assume I'd choose instruments.” Next, J-Hope was asked what is the thing he has always been better at than others. He said, \"When I meet people, I think I'm good at absorbing them. Whoever I meet, I tend to try to go along with them, and I kind of absorb things like a sponge. That would be what I'd call 'a thing I'm better at than others'.\" Jin was asked what profession would he want to choose, if not his current one. He answered, \"If I were to do something else as a profession, even though I don't sell stuff, I like to recommend things I got to friends around me. I haven't recommended anything to my members, but I think I'd like to work as a person who persuades that 'This is way better', so buy this one instead. A job of persuading that a certain product is better than others.\" Suga was asked that if he were asked a question that provokes him the most, what would it be. \"A question that provokes me? 'What can you accomplish if you're so lazy like that? What would you do with such laziness?' I think this kind of question quite provokes me. I do tend to try hard to live diligently and busily, but I'm still not satisfied, so I split my time even more. I hope to become a more diligent person, so those questions would provoke me.\" Lastly, BTS leader RM was asked if he was mentioned in the textbook 50 years later, what sentence he would like there. He said, \"If I'm to be included just 'There was this kind of person among K-pop idols'. I hope to be written as one of those 'examples'. A very unique person who loved music, worked hard and challenged on things. Just like that, I guess? If I were to be in the textbook, I think I should be an outliner.\" He concluded by saying, \"We're already in the textbook, so it's fine.\" Last year, BTS members had travelled to the US for four Los Angeles in-person concerts. They returned to South Korea in December. After that, BTS announced that they will be taking an 'extended period of rest', their first since 2019.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

And BTS leaving behind everything to fulfil the military service has become a huge talk of the town. It is a huge thing right now and everyone's talking about it A video clip from an online news portal is going viral which is about the BTS military enlistment.

She adds that the success of BTS is a mix of complex, different factors that were built over many years.

BTS' military enlistment has indeed become a huge thing in Hollywood news BTS will begin their enlistment in the military sooner than we know. Kim Seokjin aka Jin will be the first member to enlist in the military. The rest of the BTS members will follow him later as and when their schedules are complete. It has been an emotional moment but full of pride for BTS ARMYs.

He shared several throwback pictures clicked with RM, Jin, Suga, Jimin, V and Jungkook. He even shared an old hand-written letter from Jimin and also a photo of a 2012 Eminem concert ticket. He posted these on his Instagram Stories The hand-written letter, as translated by @BTStranslation_, read, \"To, Hoseokie hyung (elder brother). Ah hyung. Since this is the first time I'm writing a letter to a member, so it's a little awkward (laughs). I'm dying of the cheesiness (laughs). I couldn't celebrate hyung's birthday last year as I wanted so it kept bothering me. But this time I wanted anything at all out of (what I wanted) so I've tried preparing even if it's simple It further read, \"Happy birthday from the bottom of my heart!!! Even saying happy birthday like this feels even a first for me (laughs). This is something I always couldn't get to say but while being in Bangtan, you're guiding (us) well from beside us as much as (a) leader  Hyung probably also has a lot of worries and tough things but thank you for always working even harder than the members without showing it. It'll be hard in future too so please really take care of your body well. These days (your/our) body aches often too but. Anyway, and happy birthday from the bottom of my heart.

In 2019 BTS won Artist of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Worldwide Icon of the Year. They won all four awards three years in a row in 2019, 2020, and 2021. J-Hope went up on stage to receive all the awards, representing the group. During his acceptance speech, J-Hope made a phone call to Jin. As translated by Instagram user parkjimin.bts.95, J-Hope said, \"It would have been really really nice if the members could come up and express their gratitude as well, and it’s a shame they weren’t able to. Actually, I’ve prepared one thing. Jin said he had something he wanted to say so let me quickly call him.\" After Jin received the call, J-Hope said, \"I’m doing my award acceptance speech right now, but could you just say one thing? There are many fans who want to see you.\" Jin then said, \"Hello everyone, it’s BTS Jin. I thank you so much for giving us an honorable award, and.. our army!! Our armys, thank you so so much and I love you. and our members, you've always worked hard. Our members, I love you so so much too.\" As J-Hope interrupted him, Jin said he wasn't done and continued, \"The weather’s getting colder, so everyone, please watch out so you don’t catch a cold and don’t get sick and take care of your health. I won’t be able to see anyone at official events now, but I’ll come back next time with good music. Everyone, I’ll go and come back safely from the military! Thank you!\" Reacting to the post, fans dropped crying and sad emojis. A person commented, \"Oh I'm excited, I feel sad, I feel homesick too... thank you Hobi for giving us the opportunity to hear Jin's greetings. Love you Jin we will wait for your return.\" \"What beautiful words from Jin we miss you baby. It was a beautiful gift for us.\" After his performance, J-Hope did a live session on Weverse for fans. He said, \"I tried making it a show-like performance for Jack in the Box. I finished the performance and tried my best but I do have some regrets. There's no way there won't be parts that I don't feel regretful about. \" J-Hope also said that he doesn't have regrets about his album at all as he thinks of it as 'music made by J-Hope of a certain time'. The rapper also added that he is 'fully aware it's not an album that can not make everyone content'. Talking about RM's upcoming album Indigo, J-Hope said he is 'planning to listen to it and get some healing soon'. He signed off teasing fans that he has already listened to the songs.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

Jungkook has been quite active on Instagram until now and this update on Twitter has come as a shock for the BTS ARMY. Jungkook dropped a hazy, blurry picture of himself on Big Hit's official Twitter handle for BTS. It's an extreme close-up of his face. ARMY is shocked beyond words after looking at JK in that avatar Talking about Jungkook's picture that HYBE dropped on Twitter, JK has long hair, red eyes, and reddish lips. He has a ruffled collar shirt as well. The eyebrow piercing is also being noticed by the ARMY. All in all, Jungkook is giving out the vibes of some novella. ARMY has called him a vampire due to his look in the picture. The caption of the tweet says, \"Me, Myself, and Jung Kook.\" There are hashtags Photo Folio and Editor JK. Folio usually consists of a collection of drawings, documents, etc. that represent a person's, especially an artist's, work and it seems Jungkook has been the editor for the image as well. BTS is always the biggest trend in Hollywood news Though a blurry picture, BTS ARMY is going crazy over how hot Jungkook looks. It's especially his red eyes, red lips and white skin which is giving out a vampire kind of effect to Jungkook. He has indeed opened a thirst trap for the ARMY on Twitter. They are going berserk BTS Jungkook worked with Charlie Puth on a single called Left and Right. Furthermore, he also worked on a single, Bad Decisions by Benny Blanco and Snoop Dogg alongside the rest of the vocal line of BTS - Jin (Kim Seokjin), Jimin (Park Jimin) and V (Kim Taehyung). Well, we'll do our fair share of guesswork here and we may be wrong too. As y'all know,  BTS has been actively involved in the making of Webtoon 7 Fates: Chakho. It's returning soon. Could this be Zeha's look? Or it might be a hint at Jungkook's solo project and if that is so, then something major is coming up!       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

And just a couple of hours ago, Jin came live on Weverse in honour of The Astronaut's release. It was a fun and an interesting live wherein he watched, reviewed and also shared some insight into the making of The Astronaut MV. From talking about working on lyrics of the song with Chris Martin, Coldplay's front runner, to his military enlistment, Jin poured his heart out in front of the ARMYs. In his Weverse live, Jin revealed that they did not make the announcement of BTS' military enlistment decision before the concert On 15th October, the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook – held a Yet To Come Busan concert. Two days later on 17th October, Big Hit Music announced that the BTS members have decided to enlist in the military. It was a huge shock! Jin is the first member who will enlist in the military from BTS. Mr Worldwide Handsome Jin talked about his military enlistment in the live and made a shocking revelation. This is going to blow up Hollywood News During his Weverse live, as per an ARMY translating live on Twitter, Kim Seokjin aka Jin revealed that they did not make the military enlistment announcement before the Yet To Come Busan concert because they wanted the ARMYs to be happy at the concert and enjoy it thoroughly. Jin said that he is glad that they didn't see ARMYs in tears at the concert. Jin revealed that he and the members had been having differences in when to enlist in the military. Jin said that he was planning to enlist in Summer, around in June. He also shared that he had no plans to drop any album as he had not spoken to Chris back then In the live, Jin also said that talking about military enlistment was more like a Voldemort-like word for him. However, he is relieved now that he has gotten it out of his system. In the Harry Potter franchise, Voldemort was a person who could not be named.

is such that there is no doubt that the K-Pop band is by far not only one of the most popular music groups in today's time, but also among the most iconic of all time, with Jin, J-Hope, Jimin, Jungkook, V, Suga and RM (those are the BTS members for the uninitiated) enjoying fame, fans and impact that cuts across every ethnic, cultural and geographical demographic known to us. So, it comes as no surprise that ARMY (that's what BTS fans the world over refer to themselves as) can't get enough of BTS and make it a point to keep up to date with every little development about the group So, if you consider yourself one amongst ARMY, then this latest BTS news should be right up your alley. For those of you curious about the upcoming BTS album, Proof, here's a red-hot BTS update just for you that you simply can't miss out on. Now, since Proof is an anthology album, with all BTS members selecting a mix of their favourite BTS songs as well as individual tracks, J-Hope has finally revealed why he chose the songs, Her and Ego to be a part of BTS' Proof album “There may be many predictions but there are times when I have to wear a mask to hide the sides of myself that I don’t particularly want to show other people and I sometimes hide because I didn’t want to show that side of myself either. But they are all me. I came to accept all of my sides as part of my identity, my ego because my members and ARMY accept all of me. Who I am and the way I am, is my ego and that is my Proof,” J-Hope said in a clip shared by Big Hit Music BTS Proof is slated to release on 10th June       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

leader RM has recently been appointed as the leader of strawberries. Yes, you read that right. Jin who was quarantined after getting contracted from COVID-19 has returned to meet his family in Korea. For the uninitiated, in Korea, there is a strawberry season and Jin has arrived to meet his family at the perfect time. BTS members took notice of Jin's social media timeline. RM commented on the post and appointed Jin as the official “leader of strawberries.” He wrote, 'Leader of strawberries, You went there to prove yourself'. RM's comments on Jin's post prove that he wished that he could have gone with him to eat strawberries Not just RM, but J-Hope also had something to say to Jin. Jin and J-Hope are known as 2seok and they are a treat to watch. As Jin shared his pictures from his uncle’s strawberry farm, he shared a few selfies and made ARMY's go gaga over it. J-Hope commented on his post and wrote, “Strawberries? Without seeing me?” Jin immediately replied saying, “Jwe-Hope, come take some strawberries.” ARMYs read their conversations and got to know that J-Hope is missing Jin and the two are way too cute After finishing the American schedule in December 2021, the popular South Korean pop band members have been enjoying some well-deserved rest to get back stronger. The members are enjoying their time with their families and doing what they like to do the most       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

the vehicle on 6 June 2021 as a gift to his fans in celebration of BTS’ then-upcoming 8 year anniversary and the ongoing FESTA which is a yearly commemoration of the group’s debut June 3 is celebrated as World Bicycle Day and we think who better than the man and his song to celebrate it with ‘Bicycle’, is about to turn a year old soon and the song continues to be a slow pat on the head with its rhythmic beats and slow hums that are enough to lull you into a blissfully calm cluster of moments  The number presents itself as just that, a collection of the songwriter’s feelings as he maneuvers through the many turns of his life, characteristically placing his K-pop idol life under the microscope He talks about the moment of liberation on placing his two feet on the pedals, the one that also brings him despair over the many happenings of his life and longing for freedom as the pandemic came to be  The post-chorus is a string of “Na Na”, delivering the humming nature of his ride every time he drives around the town “슬프면 자전거를 타자” is how he begins the chorus, which translates to “If you are sad, let's ride a bicycle”  It signifies his go-to activity when he feels low is bicycle riding  He further adds to his unbinding moments by choosing to talk about the miracle that is now achievable, a midday dream come true RM and co-writer John Eun’s comparison of the bike ride to precious invisible things as one dances with the wind, looking like a bird, is relatable and takes you right back to a moment of unchained existence as the two wheels roll on a paved road Just as the singer wishes for the song to be a companion on the listener’s ride, we hope you can add it to your playlist after listening to it https://www youtube com/embed/6uq3P7zeYyUJoin the biggest community of K-Pop

singer, member J-Hope is the all rounder we’ve always been looking for  His charisma surpasses any set expectations and extends to a level with a deserved appreciation for his artistry Known to run along a flow unrivaled by most others in the industry, the often rule-abiding member turns into a heart machine around his fans  Not afraid to expose his mushy side, plenty have admitted to being floored by his duality  On the other hand, his personality as Hoseok (J-Hope’s real name) is one full of undeniable stage presence  A fashion King with both his avatars, we are enamored by his talents

BTS’ agencies HYBE and BigHit refused to comment on the matter, which further raised speculations. In the latest, pictures from V’s trip to New York, he was spotted wearing a a similar to one which Jennie wore in leaked photos. Amid all the speculations, Korean news portal JTBC reported about V attending Blackpink’s private party. As per the report, the party was held at a cultural complex in Seongsu-dong, Seoul on September 14 with tight security. The event was attended by several stars from the Korean entertainment industry, ranging from actors to singers and more. V not only marked his presence at the event but also stayed for quite some time while Blackpink members--Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa attended the guests. The private party was reportedly only meant for A-listers and even managers of celebrities weren’t allowed to enter. While both the group’s agency, HYBE and YG Entertainment didn’t confirm the developments of the report, one reportedly denied even knowing about any such private event. Meanwhile, fans are divided about dating rumours of V and Jennie. Reacting to the latest update, one fan tweeted, “Idk how legit this is but to me the recent photos make it all look pretty real. I'm happy for them but I'm sad because they seemed to enjoy their trip, living as normal people and then someone decided to invade their privacy like this.” “or they could just be friends hanging out why does it always have to immediately go to people secretly dating? let people live life bro,” added another one. “Dude maybe they got closer after Paris what's a big deal in attending a party,” pointed out someone else.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

YG Entertainment has revealed the teaser of the music video of Shut Down. The full song will be out on September 16, 2022. In the video, we can see Rose, Jennie, Jisoo and Lisa. The first two girls are shown a little more prominently. This is the second song after Pink Venom. The teaser hooks you on because the sound of the song is totally different from what has been coming out from the stable of YG Entertainment. The last song, Pink Venom got some flak for being too repetitive. Music producer Teddy bore the brunt of the same. But Blinks have declared this one as the Song Of The Year Blackpink members have been in the news and how. Everyone was waiting for their comeback with bated breath. The girls will soon go on a world tour. Fans are waiting for the date announcements. Jisoo, Jennie and Lisa have all made immense news last year. Jisoo made her acting debut with Snowdrop with Jung Hae-In. The show was a controversial one but people liked Jisoo's screen presence and performance. But Lisa overshadowed them with her record-breaking single Lalisa. She also won the Best K-Pop soloist at the MTV VMAS 2022. Lisa was seen with Celina brand ambassadors at main events. Take a look at some of the reactions for the MV Teaser Jennie Kim's rap in Pink Venom was unanimously liked by music critics.

The lyrics read, \"Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight.\" In the tweet, Delhi airport also added a purple heart, which is a representation of the love between BTS and its fans, along with the hashtags #BTSArmy #BTS #AirportTwitter.\" The tweet soon went viral, with many fans asking if their numerous requests made Delhi airport join the trend. Meanwhile, some fans tagged other airports in India, asking them to join the BTS ARMY. Some believed the tweet means that BTS will make a stop in Delhi as well during their rumoured world tour. One wrote, \"This is happening!!!\" while another commented, \"Wow.....I am just waiting for when BTS comes to India.\" Other fans asked for a confirmation if the band is coming to Delhi, so that they could start saving money. One asked, “Delhi airport????!!!!! Oh my god I'm coming I'm saving up all on money. Also helllo @bts_bighit, while another commented, ”@BIGHIT_MUSIC please deny this ASAP I need to start saving money.\" A third one wrote, \"Omg I am going to rob the bank ...I am coming soon babies.\" Another concerned fan asked, \"WTF is happening. BTS flights or tour? I'm not ready. I'm broke bro. Tell me I've to prepare my organs.\" According to some fans, the ongoing phenomenon on Twitter is just a trend that started when Orlando airport tweeted a line from BTS leader RM's song Moonchild, along with a picture of a plane in a blue sky on April 25. Other airports then started sharing pictures of purple skies, along with lyrics from BTS songs. However, the trend has left many fans confused who are hoping to see BTS live.

They also recalled the famous dumpling incident (involving a heated argument between Jimin and V) and the banana incident (when Jungkook noticed fruits disappearing from the fruit basket ARMY gave him. At that time, Jungkook argued saying it was his and J-Hope got angry, threw a banana at him and said, 'You eat it all'). While taking a walk near their dorm, RM recalled how the members walked on the street every day during the initial days of their career. He also said how he and V got caught while having ice cream. Recalling the exact spot, RM said, “I got caught exactly around here. I took the ice cream cone and stuffed it in my pocket. He (the person) asked where we were going, so we just said, 'Back to our dorm'. In the end, the ice cream melted in my pocket, but I didn't want to waste it. So I took it off and ate it again.” While RM and Jimin took a walk, Jin and V feasted on Jajangmyeon (Korean noodle dish). Suga sat in his car outside the restaurant that the members frequented earlier. The members tried to figure out each other's locations as they travelled in their cars around the city. By round two, Jungkook joined RM, Jin, Jimin, and V. Suga also met J-Hope near their old dorm and screamed 'my friend' from his car. All the members met at the Jamwon Han River Park and hugged each other. For a few moments, they forgot about filming and huddled together asking each other where they first went. The crew had to interrupt asking them to face the camera. In the last round, the members were given the keyword, ARMY. Though they were together, they could not discuss which place they would go to separately. RM kept hinting to J-Hope, \"We can go back to a place we've been already.\" He suggested the Olympic Stadium. All the members were seen heading to the venue except V who chose the first showcase venue of BTS. He said, \"I'll ask ARMY if it should be the first concert or first showcase.\" However, he got shy and couldn't ask anyone despite making several attempts in Garosu-gil. The video ended with all of them meeting for lunch during which the members discussed on what to do next. RM suggested 'getting middle-aged men from just around neighbourhood and playing 7-7 volleyball'. Jungkook suggested they learn Sepak takraw, a game, Jin asked about farming, and Suga came up with the idea of racing. Jimin said, \" I want to try pole dancing too.\" RM added, \"That suits you though.\" The video ended with V goofily saying, \"Run BTS will continue running.\"       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

When a fan teased Suga saying that he's getting younger, he laughed and said, \"I'm 30, I'm not that old yet.\" Speaking about the original soundtrack, Stay Alive, that he produced for the webtoon 7 Fates Chakho, Suga asked the feedback of his viewers. As translated by Twitter user @BTStranslation_ Yoongi spoke about both the tracks--Stay Alive and Girl of My Dreams, revealing that he wrote the lyrics for the songs on the flight to the US. He also said he recorded Girl of My Dreams almost as soon as he landed there. Suga then spoke about the lyrics of Stay Alive and also about Jungkook who sang the song. \"I wrote the lyrics for Stay Alive with keeping the webtoon in mind. Jungkook recorded the song so well. The chorus was so high but he didn't even do a re-recording, it was approved at once. He's a person overflowing with talent.\" When a fan asked if Suga was working on Stay Alive in In The Soop, he replied, \"Yes right. But at the time Jungkook's melody was not put in the song. It's the one I was working on in In The Soop.\" Suga also promised ARMY that he will hold a live session on his birthday, which is on March 9. \"It's my birthday soon, I'll see you guys on my birthday. I'll come live again on my birthday,\" he said. When asked what he planned to do on his special day, Suga replied, \"What will I do on my birthday? The day after is concert day so I don't think I can do much (laughed).\" BTS will hold three concerts in Seoul this month. The BTS Permission To Dance On Stage-Seoul is scheduled on March 10, 12 and 13. The BTS member also spoke about their home concert next week, \"The concert is going to be very fun. We're preparing hard. We've been looking forward to a concert in Korea. It will still be quite chilly in March so I'm trying not to get sick.\" About their Las Vegas concert, Suga said, \"I'm excited for the Vegas concert too, the renewed venue. The stadium itself looked so cool, we saw it while passing by.\" The dates of the concerts are April 8, 9, 15 and 16. When a fan teased him saying Bangtan (BTS) is so lucky they can go to Bangtan concert, Suga laughed and said, \"Haha, they (we) go every time.\" A fan wrote, \"If I can't go to the concert I'll die\", Suga responded laughing, \"It's not like that. You can watch it online too.\" When he asked ARMY to not get 'too nervous' during ticketing and be calm, a fan said, \"Is there a way not to get nervous (about ticketing)?\" He replied, \"Just do it as you normally would. Like when you're choosing from a menu.\" The BTS members--RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook last December debuted on Instagram. Speaking about his feed, Suga said, \"I don't know what pictures to upload on Instagram. I don't know how to make my feed look pretty, either. I normally don't take pictures. I'm still not sure what this 'Instagram vibe' is all about.\" Suga who recently recovered from Covid-19, said, \"My condition is all better now. It's been like three months since I contracted it (Covid-19). People don't always catch it cause they didn't take care. No one wants to contract it on purpose. It's not your fault.\" Suga also replied when asked if his pet Holly still walks all over him, \"Yes. When I get home he comes with his clothes held in his mouth like let's go on a walk. He's sleeping right next to me every day.\"       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

The music video Pink Venom is out. The video is top class. The best part is the rap between Jennie and Lisa. The two girls have slayed it. Of course, the styling and dance is terrific. The girls kill it with their screen presence. But music producer Teddy has got mixed reactions from many listeners. They feel the song is kind of formulaic. If you listen closely to Pink Venom, it resembles Du Du Du a little. But the girls have absolutely killed it. YG Entertainment held a music conference where the girls thanked the fandom The girls said that they wanted to make a song which the fandom could enjoy. They said they were not bothered about records. The girls have practised a lot and it is evident from the smooth moves in the video. This is how fans reacted to the new music video The entire Blackpink fandom is now super busy streaming the song so that it charts globally. While the song might get mixed reactions there is no denying that the girls have done really well. The MV is also quite exceptional       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

statement, the music company said Jin will begin his process as early as October end  Others will join as as and when they are asked  (Also read: South Korea passes law allowing BTS to postpone mandatory military service)BIGHIT MUSIC is proud to announce today that the members of BTS are currently moving forward with plans to fulfill their military service  After the phenomenal concert to support Busan’s bid for the World Expo 2030, and as each individual embarks on solo endeavors, it’s the perfect time and the members of BTS are honored to serve Since the creation of BTS over ten years ago, the band has risen to international success, broken records, and catapulted K-Pop into the global stratosphere  BIGHIT MUSIC has focused to the milestone moment when it would be possible to respect the needs of the country and for these healthy young men to serve with their countrymen, and that’s now  Group member Jin will initiate the process as soon as his schedule for his solo release is concluded at the end of October  He will then follow the enlistment procedure of the Korean government  Other members of the group plan to carry out their military service based on their own individual plans  Both the company and the members of BTS are looking forward to reconvening as a group again around 2025 following their service commitment With the release of their first anthology album earlier this year it opened the path to allow the members to take some time to explore individual projects  As part of the HYBE family, we support and encourage our artists and are beyond proud that they will each now have time to explore their unique interests and do their duty by being of service to the country they call home “Yet To Come (The Most Beautiful Moment)” is more than a track from their latest album, it is a promise, there’s much more yet to come in the years ahead from BTS Thank you Military service for BTS members has long been subject of debate  Some polls show a majority of South Koreans, not just the group’s dedicated fans who are known as Army, think the group’s members should be allowed exemptions from, or be offered some alternative to, military duties Military service exemptions, however, are controversial in a country where inequality and privilege are highly touchy subjects  All male citizens aged 18 to 28 are required to serve for about two

However, Jungkook stood in front of him, while RM and Jimin posed behind him. In the second photo, Jin again posed but this time he was seen bending as he looked at the camera. Jungkook also came in front of Jin trying to block his face. J-Hope also joined RM and Jimin in the background. In another picture, Jungkook was seen holding Jin's hands from behind as J-Hope tried to kick him. RM and Jimin, in the background, were seen looking at the sky. In the next pictures, Jin tried to pose by lifting his hands, while Jimin and Jungkook ran towards him. In a photo, Jin smiled and lifted his hands pointing towards the stadium. Here, too, he was joined by Jimin and Jungkook. While Jungkook pointed his hands towards the sky, Jimin knelt on the floor making a goofy pose. The last picture showed Jin laughing as he again made a similar pose. Though the members didn't feature in the photo, a hand was seen near the camera lens. Another member was also seen trying to photobomb. For their day out, Jin wore a white and blue shirt and paired it with a pair of beige trousers. RM opted for a green T-shirt and black pants, while J-Hope was dressed in a white T-shirt, denims and black shirt. Jimin wore a white T-shirt, shirt and blue denims and Jungkook opted for an all-black ensemble. All of them wore white sneakers. Sharing the pictures, Jin captioned the post, \"Please let me take pictures alone.\" Reacting to the post, J-Hope dropped a bunch of laughing emojis. This is not the first time that the members have photobombed Jin. Earlier too on several occasions, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook teased Jin and spoilt his selfies with their goofy poses. Currently, RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook are pursuing their solo projects after they announced a break last month.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

Apart from the earlier blue and grey outfits, the BTS members were also seen in white outfits. The clip also comprised J-Hope's mirror selfies, and pictures holding the hands of the members. In the video, J-Hope said, \"I included Her and Outro: Ego in this album, Proof. Her is essentially a love song, but some ARMY interpreted the lyrics as being more complex, about feeling the pressures of having to reshape who I am for Her. There can be many different interpretations, but there are times when I have to wear a mask to hide the sides of myself that I don't particularly want to show other people.\" He also added, \"And I sometimes hid because I didn't want to show that side of myself either. But they are all me. I came to accept all of my sides as parts of my identity, my ego, because the members and ARMY accept all of me. Who I am, just as I am, my ego is my Proof.\" Reacting to the video, a fan said, \"Yes we accept all of you as you are Hobi..yesterday, today, tomorrow & forever, just be the way you want to be! I LOVE YOU.\" \"Army loves & appreciates you for all you do & are #Proof_of_JHope #JHOPE I'm getting emotional.. beloved HER,\" tweeted a person. \"Hobi is so precious, yes Ego is so powerful #Proof_of_JHope is very Beautiful like Acceptance & the most unconditional Bond between Army + BTS (Him). Aaah same Babe same. I'm getting teary eyes #BTS_Proof is such an intimate journey,\" wrote another fan. A tweet read, \"Jung Hoseok saying how Her can be a love song but also be interpreted as a complex song of hiding aspects of ourselves and him embracing all of these sides of himself as his ego to be his proof is so beautiful!\" \"Your growth of realising how every good and downside of you is all you, inspired me a lot to feel better about myself in every persona I own. thank you for sharing with us your journey of finding yourself. I love you. and will always do,\" said a person. \"My cute hope it's your freedom to show what you want to. a beautiful relationship will always have boundaries then only it can become beautiful. I'm so glad and proud that you accept and love all sides of yourself. ARMY will always love you. Thank you for choosing Her and Ego,\" said a fan.

We would like to inform you that the event and content below have been postponed. 12 PM, October 30 (KST) Stationhead Listening Party. 0 AM, October 31 (KST) The Astronaut Lyric Video.\" In another tweet, it added, \"The changed schedules will be announced through a separate notice. We ask for your generous understanding. Thank you.\" The announcement comes after over 150 people were killed in a stampede at a Halloween event in Seoul, as per news agency AFP. The crowd surge and crush hit in the capital's popular Itaewon district, where police estimate as many as 100,000 people -- mostly in their teens and 20s -- went to celebrate Halloween Saturday night. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol declared a period of national mourning on Sunday, telling the country in a televised address that \"a tragedy and disaster occurred that should not have happened\". He said the government \"will thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and make fundamental improvements to ensure the same accident does not occur again in the future\". The postponement of the listening party and The Astronaut lyric video comes after Jin's recent performance of his first-ever solo at Coldplay's concert in Argentina. This was Jin's last live performance ahead of enlisting for mandatory military service. Recently, BigHit Music said the seven members, RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook would enlist in the military. This put an end to a debate about whether they should be exempt from the mandatory service requirement of about two years. Jin, the eldest of the group, said he would sign up in December. The group has said they hope to reconvene by 2025.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

The first picture was a selfie in which Jungkook pouted as he kept his arm around Jay Park, who flashed a huge smile. In the second picture, both of them posed against a music workstation. Sharing the pictures, Jay wrote, “Even though he’s at the top, he has a growth mindset and he’s humble. What a stud… Plus he’s good at boxing… After I met Jk I can definitely see why they get so much love. Humble, [ambitious] and talented.\" Jungkook shared the post on his Instagram Stories. The post soon received several comments from fans asking if Jungkook is planning to collaborate with the American rapper, who was previously a part of K-pop group 2PM. Many fans commented \"OMG,\" with one writing, \"Are they making music together?? Collab?\" Another commented, \"Right now I will start praying that they make a song together, out of Jungkook's comfort zone, something Jay Park style.\" However, a large section of ARMY was not happy about the meeting and took to Twitter to say that they cannot forgive Jay Park. The Seattle-based rapper had risen to fame as the leader of the South Korean boy band 2PM in 2008. But he left the band and South Korea and returned home the next year following a major controversy when the comments he wrote about Korea in 2005 as a teenager were publicised by the Korean media. In addition, he had also previously criticised BTS in several tweets. He wrote in one such tweet in 2018, “Two ppl on the plane asked me if I was part of BTS … lol I need to get my weight up.\" ARMY cited these tweets as they suggested that Jungkook is posing with him because he is being held hostage. \"Free Jungkook of Jay Park,\" one wrote, while another commented, \"Free Jungkook. he only did what he had to do he didn’t mean it #jkheldhostage #jkhostagesituation.\" A third one wrote, \"Jungkook prolly the nicest person on earth i know damn well that mf had a gun on the other side forcing him to take a selfie ! praying jungkook got home safely without finding out he lost his wallet #freejungkook.\" Another commented, \"Jay Park the biggest hypocrite ever because he acted like he didn't shade BTS and ARMYS in the past but now he's all smiling and acting like a saint.\" Meanwhile, BTS members Jungkook, Jin, Jimin, J-Hope, Suga, and V have returned to South Korea after their Permission to Dance concert in Las Vegas.

He simply wrote Jimin's name and 'happy birthday' in two posts, before sharing a video which according to BTS ARMY was both sultry and hilarious at the same time. Instead of sharing a video of Jimin or saying something about him, Jungkook showed himself off in the video. He started by slowly removing his glasses, playing with his hair, and giving sultry looks at the camera for a whole minute before he whispered at the end of the video, \"Jjyaman, happy birthday, happy birthday bro.\" Interestingly, it was also his first post on Weverse since 2019. Jin also chose a somewhat similar manner to wish Jimin. Taking to Weverse, he shared a selfie that had a whole lot of him and only a glimpse of Jimin, and wrote, \"Jimin-ah Happy birthday.\" Band leader RM shared a cute picture of Jimin with his eyes closed on Instagram to wish him, while J-Hope shared a video of him and Jimin and pictures of the birthday boy from a plane on Instagram Stories to mark the day. Suga wrote in his birthday message, \"happy birthday Jiyaman...I guess you'll spend your birthday week in Busan hahahahahaha HBD!\" V also took to Instagram Stories to share a selfie of him and Jimin edited with a sketch filter. Meanwhile, Jimin came on VLIVE like every year to ring in his birthday with his fans, and cut his birthday cake while talking to ARMY. He said, \"So many of you came and I want to quickly give these flowers to you. On my birthday that isn't too special, I thankfully received an undeserved amount of congratulations from so many ARMYs. I won't forget today and will treasure it happily. I love you.\"       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

He is performing at the inaugural function along with other big musical acts. The Golden Maknae is one of the star performers of the show. He met this little girl at a mall, and her aunt shared the interaction. She said he was a sweet and humble lad. This is the best thing you will see today The girl apparently told Jungkook that she knew who he was but did not know his name. Jungkook gave a surprised reaction. This is the line he had once said in a Hollywood interview when he said he knew the face of his crush (Hollywood actress) but did not know the name Fans have been trying to make Jungkook's Qatar stay as peaceful as possible. But fans have gathered where he is shooting just to wave at him from a distance. Jungkook returned the love He was at the Vendome Mall. It seems he shopped at the Balenciaga outlet. The mall has the best brands from all over the world The pop icon made Bunny Ears on her as her aunt made a small video. Even the bodyguard was smiling. Jungkook looked adorable in the Tik Tok video The girl's aunt said her niece was on cloud nine seeing Jungkook. She wrote on Twitter, That one time you are at the mall and saw #jungkook \r\n",

have he and the other members - RM, Jin, Jimin, J-Hope, V, and Suga - have no plans of breaking up the band anytime soon. While the English subtitles for the VLive video haven’t popped up yet, a representative told Billboard that Jungkook said in the livestream that the band isn't going to stop working together as a team and is not disbanding. He added in the livestream that they will continue to do projects as a group, one of which is the filming of their web series Run BTS. As per a fan's translation of the VLive, Jungkook said, \"Since there was all a mess saying we are disbanding and what not. We are not disbanding guys, there are still a lot of things we need to do as a group. BTS is forever.\" Jungkook's clarification came soon after RM wrote a long letter addressing the reports of hiatus and disbanding. He said, \"When I took a look at the screenshots and article titles (people sent to me), there were quite a lot of provocative and partially interpreted keywords in them such as disband, hiatus, big announcement, etc. It's not like we didn't know this will take place nor that we didn't prepare for this but indeed it feels bitter.” Big Hit Entertainment which manages the group also clarified soon after reports emerged that the band is only shifting focus on their solo careers and not taking a hiatus. BTS recently marked the 9th anniversary of its debut.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

BLACKPINK's Blinks and TWICE's Onces have been embroiled in a heated debate on social media ever since the Dahyun incident. It so happened that Kim Da-Hyun was doing a live with her fans when Lisa's music video, Lalisa came. As we know, it is one of the biggest K-Pop hits of 2021-22. The song is a bop and Lisa has picked up awards for the same. Da-hyun was playing songs of TWICE for fans when she skipped the music video of Lalisa that apparently came as an ad. This did not go down well with a certain section of Blackpink fandom. As per some Blinks, Da-hyun apparently lied that she did not have YT Premium account After that incident, tempers of TWICE and BLACKPINK fans rose on social media. As we know, verbal slurs on Twitter can be very derogatory and both fandoms slugged it out. Now, TWICE have written on Twitter that some Blinks cyber bullied and doxxed an admin of one of their biggest fan pages. Doxxing is leaking out someone's private information on social media with a malicious intent. This has apparently affected the health of the person who is now seeking treatment in a hospital. The hashtag #Blinkscyberbullying' is trending since early morning. Take a look at the tweets What has upset many is that the name of Jonghyun has been dragged in too. Fans know that he is a late K-Pop vocalist who died by suicide. It is one of the biggest recent tragedies in the industry. The BLACKPINK members are busy with their comeback, Pink Venom which is doing quite well       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

There’s also Indian ARMY (fans of BTS) who are very active on social media. A couple of days ago, a video went viral on social in which an Indian teacher while taking an online class shouted at a girl who was commenting ‘BTS ARMY’. He got pissed with it and spoke a few bad things about BTS. This of course didn’t go down well with ARMY and they were bashing him on social media The above video had started trending in Hollywood news. Now, the man has shared an apology video. In the video, he says that his family told him that the way he behaved was rude and spoke a lot of things. So, he takes his words back. But, he also said that the girl was also wrong for commenting ‘BTS ARMY’ and she should not do that as other students who are genuinely asking questions get disturbed Not just this, he also praised BTS. He said that he respects the music. The band is very good; they have done a lot of hard work, so there’s no reason to defame them BTS has seven members – Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. While ARMY loves them together, even individually these K-pop band members have a huge fan following. ARMY has always come together to support BTS whenever someone tried to troll the band or band members. Now, that’s what we call a great fan following!       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

They are currently in the number position with many accolades to their name. Well, one more has been added to the list. The Bangtan boys comprising Jimin, Jin, J-Hope, Jungkook, Suga, RM and V won big at the 37th Golden Disc Awards. For the sixth consecutive year, they won the Album of the Year award apart from many other awards. It is a big deal and BTS ARMY (as fans are known) cannot keep calm. Among all the seven, it was Jung Hoseok aka J-Hope who represented the band at the awards night in Thailand Hoseok is currently trending on Twitter as fans are totally impressed with his acceptance speech. He thanked the ARMY for being their constant support. He also thanked BigHit Music. He revealed that the boys had a drink last evening after a long time and they missed Jin as he is serving in the military. His cuteness also left fans rooting for him. He sweetly adjusted the mic to break into a little dance too       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

            "The question, however, remained: where did the thought of &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; first begin? Who first approached whom and if any difficulties stood between them while working on the song  Taeyang held a countdown live broadcast an hour before dropping the song on THEBLACKLABEL&rsquo;s YouTube channel and delved into the details of this collaboration \n",

            "To his rescue, last year there were a few dinners that the BIGBANG member got invited to where he had an opportunity to meet BTS  Taeyang spoke about coming across the group&rsquo;s members one by one and eventually becoming acquainted with Jimin  Simple chats later, they ended up talking about working together some day and Taeyang asked Jimin if he&rsquo;d like for them to make music together which finally resulted in going to the studio and working on the track that is now called &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; \n",

wrote, \"There's (just) a day left until our dongsaeng's (younger sibling in Korean) birthday.\" Jimin also shared a photo of all the BTS members – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, V and Junkook – including himself. He wrote, \"Jungkook is appearing on the TV whoa, Instagram too... The reason I haven't shown my face these days is since I gained weight but I'm dieting once again though. Please wait a little bit.\" Speaking about doing a live session for the ARMY, BTS fans, Jimin said, \"I'll do it in near future. I was just living on while trying to make music. I once again realised that our members are people who are so so good (at making music) and amazing.\" He also said, \"Our ARMY, I really miss you. I want to meet everyone together and just chat.\" When a fan asked why he didn't sleep, Jimin replied, \"I woke up after sleeping earlier.\" He said 'it seems that' when another person asked if his 'night owl life started again'. Several fans wrote about shaving their hair, and not breathing if Jimin didn't reply to their comments. Reacting to it, the singer said, \"In order to get a comment you guys keep saying ‘I'm shaving my hair, I won't breath'. You guys are cute. Since it's late, please go to sleep.\" A person asked Jimin to rate his love for ARMY and the singer said, \"What is there to even say?\" Ahead of signing out, Jimin said, \"It was fun guys. I'll go for the time being.\"       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

with his recent release Donda 2, Mike Dean pinned his angst in the wrong direction, being the producer on the album, he apparently aimed his anger at BTS with his diss tweets on the South Korean mega act On April 4, the Recording Academy was crushing over BTS with a tweet that read, via ET Canada, \"Name a group ~smoother~ than @bts_bighit, we dare you  #BTSARMY #GRAMMYs,\" to which Dean replied with an unsolicited snarky tweet and wrote, \"Anyone \" Soon, the BTS ARMY gathered to condemn the producer for his hate comment on the group  Initially, Dean engaged with the comments even going as far as accusing the group of not being active participants in writing their own songs when a fan pointed out Dean's \"disgusting\" behaviour  He escalated the drama and wrote, \"There is no way BTS members have writen 90% of their music  Just check the writing credits of every single BTS album \" This enraged the fans and shocked them equally as the supposed \"beef\" came out of nowhere  Fans then began speculating that Dean's remarks must have been inspired after being rejected by the group, the confusion was later sorted out when Dean finally admitted his wrongdoings and tweeted, \"Ok folks  I was mad about album of the year and made a post I shouldn’t have made  My gf just made me feel bad for it \" Check out Mike Dean's hateful tweets toward BTS below:https://twitter

In a recent interview, Snoop Dogg said that their collab is official like 'a referee with a whistle'. He also said that BTS makes good music and so does he. BTS comprises RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. Earlier in January, Snoop Dogg revealed that BTS had asked him for a collaboration. This is not the first time that BTS will be collaborating with a solo artist. The group has so far collaborated with Steve Aoki, The Chainsmokers, Nicki Minaj, Halsey, Lauv, Coldplay, Megan Thee Stallion among others. Recently, speaking with The AV Club, Snoop Dogg said, “The BTS experience you keep talking about. I’m going to let them tell you about it. It’s official like a referee with a whistle. I love that entertainment world. It’s good music. It’s [a] vibe. I make good music. They make good music. And we end up doing this. This is what it’s always about, bringing our worlds together.” Earlier this year, Snoop Dogg told Mogul Talk podcast, “I got a group named BTS that's waiting on me to do a song with them right now. And I'm trying to figure out if I got time to do that s***.” Another guest from the show, Crystal Mais had said, “That would be fire. BTS is dope. The K-pop market is huge, Snoop. Do it.” BTS had first hinted at their admiration for the 50-year-old rapper when they included a nod to his debut album Doggystyle in their 2014 track Hip Hop Phile. Currently, BTS is gearing up for their concert in the US next month. BTS recently extended their Permission to Dance On Stage tour by four shows at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. The group is set to perform at the venue on April 8, April 9, April 15, and April 16. Almost all the BTS members have contracted Covid-19 after their US concert, which ended in December last year. In addition to coronavirus, Jin and Jimin had to undergo surgery as well. Last December, Suga, RM, and Jin had tested positive for the coronavirus. In January, Jimin went through surgery for acute appendicitis while also recovering from Covid-19. In February, V tested positive for Covid-19. Last weeek, J-hope also tested positive for coronavirus. His diagnosis comes just ahead of the group's departure for the US, where they are scheduled to perform at the 2022 Grammys ceremony too. BTS have also been nominated at the Grammys for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for Butter.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

However, they have also asked for more time to share details about the much-awaited album amid collaboration speculations. “Jin will release his solo single at the end of October,” Soompi quoted the agency as saying. When asked about reports of collaboration between Jin and Coldplay, the rep commented, “The exact details of the date and time, collaboration, and more will be revealed later. We ask for your understanding.” Meanwhile, BTS members — RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook — will be soon joining the compulsory military service in South Korea. Jin will be the first one to begin his process for the same around October-end, after wrapping up his work commitments. Others will join as and when they are asked to. The agency said in a statement, “BIGHIT MUSIC is proud to announce today that the members of BTS are currently moving forward with plans to fulfill their military service. After the phenomenal concert to support Busan’s bid for the World Expo 2030, and as each individual embarks on solo endeavors, it’s the perfect time and the members of BTS are honored to serve.” “Since the creation of BTS over ten years ago, the band has risen to international success, broken records, and catapulted K-Pop into the global stratosphere. BIGHIT MUSIC has focused to the milestone moment when it would be possible to respect the needs of the country and for these healthy young men to serve with their countrymen, and that’s now. Group member Jin will initiate the process as soon as his schedule for his solo release is concluded at the end of October. He will then follow the enlistment procedure of the Korean government.

RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook were seen having a gala time performing flying yoga. The majority of the part included warming up and stretching so that the Bangtan Boys could not face a lot of difficulties while performing the postures on the hammock. After watching the episode of Run BTS, the boys fit into various categories of students. Yes, you read that right In the latest episode of Run BTS, Park Jimin aka Jimin was seen impressing not just the teacher but also the other members. Jimin was acing every posture that the teacher taught or showcased, and with ease too. The other members such as J-Hope, Suga, RM and Jin were impressed with Jimin's flexibility and agility. Jimin definitely fit in the ace of the class or the topper of the class category The Run BTS episode is the top trend in Hollywood News. Talking about the episode, Kim Namjoon aka RM and the Golden Maknae Jungkook were seen having a lot of fun. While Jungkook was goofing around a lot, RM was pretty chilled. They both managed to do the postures and have fun as well. So, they fit in the mischievous kind who managed to do tasks/pass category Kim Taehyung did not fuss about acing every posture and did his bit but was kinda laidback. He was pretty chilled on in the Flying Yoga class and didn't mind being a spectator when things seemed difficult. He comes in that category who work as much to just pass exams. Yep, that kind Min Yoongi aka Suga comes into that category wherein the student is very hard-working but lacks somehow. Suga was very sincere doing his best in every posture but he struggled a lot too. He also cheered on the members when they seemed tired In the latest episode of Run BTS, Jung Hoseok aka J-Hope was seen clueless about every posture and the teacher almost helped him every time. He struggled a lot as well. He tried to copy others but was very scared to attempt it. So, Hobi comes in the category of being clueless and scared category Kim Seokjin aka Jin belonged to the category who was poor in all subjects kinda category. Though he attempted everything with sincerity, Jin was seen struggling to survive on the basics as well. He entertained not just the teacher and the members but also the ARMY. In case you haven't seen the episode yet, here you go: Meanwhile, it was a joyous moment for the ARMYs when Big Hit dropped a teaser of Run BTS' episode a couple of days ago.

            "Soon after some relentless training at JYP Entertainment that saw the members of Stray Kids being chosen, Han cemented his place in the group  Over the many years of being active as an idol, Han has had the opportunity to showcase his many skills and has even been called the 4th Generation ace  Why is that so? Let&rsquo;s find out \n",

            "Rap:\n",
            "It&#39;s no brainer that Han is a fabulous rapper  Alongside fellow Stray Kids members Bang Chan and Changbin, who complete the 3RACHA, he has released free-to-listen songs displaying his rap and song-writing skills  Penning down his own lines, the young idol has shared some very profound and developed thinking over the years \n",

            "Dance:\n",
            "Being in the world of K-pop, it&rsquo;s a given that one has to hone their dance skills  Stray Kids is known for their kalgunmu, which is basically their knife-sharp moves and Han stands as one of the 8 pillars of the team in every performance  Having participated in some of the most complex and demanding sequences, it is a sure-shot confirmation that Han is a skilled dancer \n",

            "It is always surprising to see rappers give their everything for their singing  Han does just that and then some while holding the mix for a vocal part  He is possibly the member who can reach the highest tone and his many attempts at putting out vocal parts have been nothing short of brilliant \n",

Indigo performance with fans but minors can't attend)In the song, RM expresses his desire to live like a wildflower rather than a spark that disappears quickly  The turmoil in his mind is beautifully reflected in the video  In the track, RM also talks about his journey, his dreams, what he wanted and what he has achieved The lyrics of the song start with, \"Flower field, that's where I'm at/ Open land, that's where I'm at/ No name, that's what I have/ No shame, I'm on my grave/ When your feet don't touch the ground/ When your heart underestimates you/ When your dream devours you/ When you feel you're not yourself/ All those times I yearned for the flames \"Reacting to the song, a fan said, \"Now that I'm done crying  Namjoon (RM) you truly are so special! I’m so proud of all your accomplishments and I can tell that you put everything into this song, always making me proud to be a fan!!\" Another person said, \"This is a masterpiece in every single way  I cannot accurately describe how much I love this  Kim NamJoon you are amazing \"A comment read, \"This is so beautiful but sweetly painful at the same time  So deep  Namjoon you are an incredible artist, like how can someone transmit all these emotions and so much in few minutes? I don't know how to explain this, it's complex, gives me peace but at the same time, I want to cry  Youjeen's voice!?? Her vocals are so pretty!! And the mv is so beautiful!!\"RM's album consists of 10 tracks  The rapper collaborated with several other musicians such as Erykah Badu, Tablo, Kim Sawol, Mahalia, Colde and Paul Blanco, among others, for the songs  Earlier, BTS agency BigHit Music had introduced Indigo an album like a diary that contains RM's thoughts and worries RM said on his SNS that he has been preparing for the album since early 2019  With the single, RM became the third member to debut as a solo artist after J-Hope and Jin  RM has previously shown his own musical ability by releasing mixtapes, including RM and MONO       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

showed Hyun Bin a picture of BTS' Jimin, he went blank and struggled to recognise him. He opened his mouth, made a face and brought his fists near his eyes. Yoon-ah asked him, \"Will you be okay?\" As he smiled and joined his hands, Hyun Bin blurted out, \"Jimin.\" A seemingly embarrassed Hyun Bin asked the camerapersons, \"Please blur me\" and added, \"Whew. It is getting hot.\" Na PD then suggested, \"I will put Hyun Bin's face when we play this game with Jimin later. I will make him get the wrong answer. It will be a tie.\" Hyun Bin replied, \"No, it shouldn't be a tie. I don't want a tie.\" Confidential Assignment 2: International is a South Korean action film directed by Lee Suk-hoon. It is the sequel to the 2017 film Confidential Assignment. Apart from Hyun Bin and Im Yoon-ah, the film also stars Yoo Hae-jin, Daniel Henney, and Jin Seon-kyu. The film released earlier this month. Hyun Bin also has The Point Men, an action crime thriller film directed by Yim Soon-rye, in the pipeline. The film also stars Hwang Jung-min. BTS' Jimin along with group members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, V and Jungkook will hold an in-person concert in Busan next month to promote South Korea's bid for World Expo 2030. The concert named BTS Yet To Come in BUSAN will be held at Asiad Main Stadium on October 15. Earlier it was supposed to take place at Busan Ilgwang special stage in Gijang-gun.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

I don’t really have any left.\" An ARMY asked Jin to do a live stream of him playing games and he replied, \"I almost destroyed my TV while playing Elden ring.\" A fan said that Jin will get a lot of ad offers, he said, \"I don’t do many ads because working to make ARMYs happy comes first rather than making money.\" When a fan suggested that they will look forward to a 'mukbang (an eating show) with drinking', Jin responded, \"I should do it with a member. Who should I eat with?\" A fan asked Jin to give them makgeolli (Korean alcoholic beverage) as they can drink it in four years. He said, \"They say if you don’t make a brand, it’s illegal to give alcohol. That’s why I couldn’t give it to the members either. I have to invite you to my house to drink it.\" \"Not to be dramatic but I'm going to die from a broken heart,\" said an ARMY. \"Oh no. And it will be cold for him too. I hope he will be able to pass this winter safely,\" said a person. Another fan wrote, \"This tore me up! I’m sorry I just can’t do this y’all.\" Last month, BTS agency BigHit Music announced the group members' mandatory military service. It said that the seven members would enlist in the military, putting an end to a debate about whether they should be exempt from the mandatory service requirement of about two years. Jin said he would sign up in December. The group has said they hope to reconvene by 2025.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

inked took only two minutes. During the interaction with fans, RM said in English, “It took 2 hours to stamp on the body to check the font and positions, but it took me only 2 damn minutes to have an actual tattoo on my body. It was only two lines. one line \"oh ouch\" 2nd line \"oh ouch\" and done.” Previously, RM had shared a glimpse of his friendship tattoo with fans, which seems to be the BTS leader’s tribute to his seven-member band. 7 was also the name of the BTS’ 2020 album. After the members discussed getting themselves inked on several occasions, J-hope, Jimin and Jin also have similar tattoos. Talking about tattoos, V earlier said on Weverse, “We’ve been talking about friendship tattoos forever. We’ll do it someday. Please look forward to it.” RM also once mentioned that members have had discussions about getting a friendship tattoo. \"Let’s tattoo seven dots or do seven of something. Or just simply tattoo the number seven. But if we’re actually doing it, I want to do it on the ankle. You know, it’s simple,” he said. Currently, BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook are on a break to focus on their individual career goals. Announcing their hiatus, RM had said while he enjoyed being in BTS, the group members now feel \"exhausted\" and he doesn't \"know what kind of group we were any more\". Their last album Proof was released last month.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",
